# glob_deny_hosts
#
# Trust based rule file to define addresses that are implicitly denied.
#
# Format of this file is line-seperated addresses, IP masking is supported.
# Example:

# 192.168.5.0/24
# 
# advanced usage
#
# The trust rules can be made in advanced format with 4 options
# (proto:flow:port:ip);
# 1) protocol: [packet protocol tcp/udp]
# 2) flow in/out: [packet direction, inbound or outbound]
# 3) s/d=port: [packet source or destination port]
# 4) s/d=ip(/xx) [packet source or destination address, masking supported]
#
# Syntax:
# proto:flow:[s/d]=port:[s/d]=ip(/mask)
# s - source , d - destination , flow - packet flow in/out
#
# Examples:
# inbound to destination port 22 from 192.168.2.1
# tcp:in:d=22:s=192.168.2.1
#
# outbound to destination port 23 to destination host 192.168.2.1
# out:d=23:d=192.168.2.1
#
# inbound to destination port 3306 from 192.168.5.0/24
# d=3306:s=192.168.5.0/24
