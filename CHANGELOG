      - The old versioning scheme had no real value and had become a never
        ending release tree 

- 0.9.6
(rev:3)
[Fix] the cli_trust_remove() function was not checking global trust rules
      before passing allow/deny addresses onto the firewall which caused
      conflicting trust data if the same address was present in more than
      a single rule file

         (global)trust system chains
[Change] modified the trust system to load rules into specific chains to better

         installations

[Change] SYSCTL_TCP now sets tcp_sack, tcp_dsack and tcp_fack enabled for
         more reliable connections, especially over otherwise unreliable links
[Fix] SYSCTL_TCP was setting tcp_fin_timeout to an inordinately high value, 
      this was not "that" dangerous as this value only controls FIN-WAIT-2
      socket states which eat a maximum of 1.5k of memory - was just bad form
[New] added USE_ECNSHAME to set postrouting rules to turn off ECN while
      communicating with hosts that have known broken TCP/IP implementations
      from the ECN SHAME list, dependant on SYSCTL_ECN being enabled

         of the variable descriptions reworded or expanded
[Change] reworded some of the usage descriptions on the apf command

[Fix] extended tcp/ip packet header logging would only apply to the default
      drop chains and not custom drop chains like dshield
[New] md5sum validation of *.rule & *.networks files for fast load expiration
      on detected file changes

[Fix] the dshield chain was not properly logging under certain circumstances
[Change] created line spaces between (rev:#) statements under the same 
         release tree in CHANGELOG file

[Change] init script used an old custom flush routine on stops, now set to use
         the apf flush() function

      using iptables-save/restore commands
[Fix] some apf operations that would output data to the log file were not 
      properly stating the subsystem they were called from
[Fix] the VF_LGATE feature was trying to turn on even when disabled, this had
      no real implication other than an empty chain being created - just messy
[Fix] the P2P block rules were not part of a chain and had no capacity to log
      like other block rules
[Change] all custom filtering chains have been redesigned for more efficent 
         packet flow patterns - this also makes the apf -l (iptables -L) output
         MUCH cleaner and opens up more feature possibilities in the future
[Change] LOG_IA chain updated to reflect HELPER_SSH_PORT value
[New] vnet rules now created for addresses on interfaces other than those 
      set by IFACE_* vars - added SET_ADDIFACE to conf.apf for toggling - 
      detailed description of this feature in conf.apf caption for the var
[Change] vnet rules now skipped for addresses no longer bound to interfaces
[Fix] updated functions.apf to accommodate ipt_state/ipt_multiport now 
      known as xt_ in kern 2.6.15+
[Change] replace DSTOP target with ALL_STOP, antidos and conf.apf updated
[Change] modified the statful connection helper chains for SSH and FTP to be
	 togglable through conf.apf as HELPER_SSH/HELPER_FTP - also makes
	 APF more portable when you desire to change these service ports
[Fix] The variable naming scheme for interfaces was inconsistent in some rule
      files, although the old variables for interfaces are backward compatible
      - it just looks better when things appear as intended

      changes auto-propigate to APF installs from the US_RD feature:
